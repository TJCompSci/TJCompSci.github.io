## Placement Test Info
TJ offers a placement test each year for students who wish to place out of Foundations of Computer Science (the required 1st year course) and move directly into the AP Comptuer Science A w/ Data Structures course.  More information forthcoming.  

## Course Descriptions
<br>
**[Foundations of Computer Science](https://academics.tjhsst.edu/compsci/CSweb/index.html)**<br>
> This course is a standard 2nd semester college level course on algorithims and data structures in an object-oriented environment. The sorting algorithims studied include selection, insertion, merge, quick, and heap. The data structures studied include arrays, array lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, maps, and graphs. Additional topics include recursion, the Java Collections framework, Big-O analysis, and class design. The programming language is Java. Students taking this course should be independent thinkers able to spend a significant amount of time at a computer outside of class. Approximately 75% of the time is spent learning material that is above and beyond the material on the AP Computer Science A exam.  Prerequisite:  Foundations of Computer Science
