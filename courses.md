## Placement Test Info
TJ offers a placement test each year for students who wish to place out of Foundations of Computer Science (the required 1st year course) and move directly into the AP Comptuer Science A w/ Data Structures course.  More information forthcoming.  

## Course Descriptions
<br>
**[Foundations of Computer Science](https://academics.tjhsst.edu/compsci/CSweb/index.html)**<br>
> This course is a standard 2nd semester college level course on algorithims and data structures in an object-oriented environment. The sorting algorithims studied include selection, insertion, merge, quick, and heap. The data structures studied include arrays, array lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, maps, and graphs. Additional topics include recursion, the Java Collections framework, Big-O analysis, and class design. The programming language is Java. Students taking this course should be independent thinkers able to spend a significant amount of time at a computer outside of class. Approximately 75% of the time is spent learning material that is above and beyond the material on the AP Computer Science A exam.  Prerequisite:  None

**Foundations of Computer Science Accelerated**<br>
> Accelerated Foundations of Computer Science is offered as differentiated instruction at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. It is meant to be an introductory computer science course for students who know some computer science but not enough to pass the Placement Test into APCS-A plus Data Structures. The course is noted by its instruction in both Python and Java computer languages, and its pace of instruction. It will cover more material at a faster pace than Foundations of Computer Science. In addition, it will cover a number of non-programming computer science topics. It will prepare students to take the second year course, APCS-A plus Data Structures.  Prerequisite:  None

**AP Computer Science A with Data Structures**<br>
> This course is a standard 2nd semester college level course on algorithims and data structures in an object-oriented environment. The sorting algorithims studied include selection, insertion, merge, quick, and heap. The data structures studied include arrays, array lists, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, maps, and graphs. Additional topics include recursion, the Java Collections framework, Big-O analysis, and class design. The programming language is Java. Students taking this course should be independent thinkers able to spend a significant amount of time at a computer outside of class. Approximately 75% of the time is spent learning material that is above and beyond the material on the AP Computer Science A exam.  Prerequisite:  Foundations of Computer Science

**Artificial Intelligence 1**<br>
>  Students study AI techniques in a variety of contexts with an emphasis on generalizing search algorithms. Topics include graphs, heuristics, recursion, pruning, constraint solvers and games. Programming assignments include word ladders, navigating across Romania, map coloring, Sudoku, GHOST and Reversi. The programming language is Python.  Prerequisite:  AP Computer Science A with Data Structures
