title: Clubs & Activities
---

Eighth Period is an integral part of the TJ school day.  It is an opportunity for students to get academic support,  explore a new interest, pursue a passion, or socialize with friends in a supervised activity. Students may decide to participate in the same clubs or activities on a regular basis, or participate in a wide variety.<br>

We offer many of the same activities and clubs that a traditional school offers, as well as some that can only be offered because of the unique technical laboratories and nature of the school.<br>

In 2017-18, there are more than 180 clubs and activities, with the following nine activities being primarily computing focused.<br>
