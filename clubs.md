title: Clubs & Activities
---

Eighth Period is an integral part of the TJ school day.  It is an opportunity for students to get academic support,  explore a new interest, pursue a passion, or socialize with friends in a supervised activity. Students may decide to participate in the same clubs or activities on a regular basis, or participate in a wide variety.<br>

We offer many of the same activities and clubs that a traditional school offers, as well as some that can only be offered because of the unique technical laboratories and nature of the school.<br>

In 2017-18, there are more than 180 clubs and activities.  While there also exist clubs that involve technology and robotics, the following nine activities are primarily computing focused.  <br>

## Clubs

**[Computer Security Club](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/csc/)**  
> CSC is designed to introduce students to and pique their interests in a field which is readily gaining importance in an increasingly   technology-dependent world. Most 8th period blocks are lectures on security topics chosen by club attendees. Occasionally, blocks may  be spent participating in CTFs, watching relevant videos, or listening to guest speakers.
